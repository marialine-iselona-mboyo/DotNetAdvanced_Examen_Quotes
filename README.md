<br>

To be able to see the quotes, you will have to Sing in or to Sign up if you don't have an account. <br>
On the Sign in page, you will be able to see a Button "Login" and 2 links, the "Home" en "Please, Sign up".<br>
If you click on the "Home" link, you will redirected to the Home page. And if you click <br> 
on the "Please, Sign up!" link, you will be redirected to the Sign up form. <br>

<br>
On the Sign up page, you will be able to see a Button "Sign up" and 2 links, the "Home" en "Please, Sign in".<br>
If you click on the "Home" link, you will redirected to the Home page. And if you click <br> 
on the "Please, Sign in!" link, you will be redirected to the Sign in form. <br>

When you get in, you will be able to see the today's generated quotes. They will be displayed randomly, so that every time you click on the "Generate" button, 
you will be able to see a quote going from <i>Forest Gump</i> to <i>Victor Hugo</i>. <br>

<br>

If you choose for "Log Out", you will be logged out and redirected to the Home page.<br>
If you chose for "Mood Quotes", you will be redirected to another form. <br>
On this form, by clicking on the menu, you will be able to choose if you wanna go back to the main form (Today's Quote), what kind of quotes you want to see, and logout. <br>
For the different mood quotes, you will be able to chosse between "Happy", "Love" and, "Sad" quotes. <br>

<br>

When you have choosen which mood quote you want to read, it will open in front of you, without having to change forms. <br>
Thiis basically what you will see on every mood page. <br>

<br>

When you press on the "Next" button, it wil randomly generate another quote. <br>
When you press on the "Exit" button, it will close the page and go back.

And this is it.
I hope you like it.

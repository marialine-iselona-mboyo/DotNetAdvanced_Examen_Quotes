To be able to see the quotes, you will have to Sing in or to Sign up if you don't have an account. <br>
On the Sign in page, you will be able to see a Button "Login" and 2 links, the "Home" en "Please, Sign up".<br>
If you click on the "Home" link, you will redirected to the Home page. And if you click <br> 
on the "Please, Sign up!" link, you will be redirected to the Sign up form. <br>
